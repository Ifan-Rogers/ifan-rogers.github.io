Shwmae!
======
I'm a Foundation Climate Scientist at the Met Office, working within the monthly to decadal predictability and impacts team to better understand compound climate extremes impacting the energy sector.

Before moving to Exeter at the start of 2025, I did an integrated masters in physics at the University of Oxford where I studied atmospheric and oceanic physics as well as theoretical physics in my 4th year. I also completed an oceanography research project on the bifurcations between periodic and chaotic regimes of El Ni√±o events within a delayed oscillator model.
