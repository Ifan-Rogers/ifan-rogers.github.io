Shwmae!
======
I'm a Foundation Climate Scientist at the Met Office, working within the monthly to decadal predictability and impacts team to better understand compound climate extremes impacting the energy sector.

Before moving to Exeter at the start of 2025, I did an integrated masters in physics at the University of Oxford where I studied atmospheric and oceanic physics as well as theoretical physics in my 4th year. I also completed an oceanography research project on the bifurcations between periodic and chaotic regimes of El Ni√±o events within a delayed oscillator model. 

I'm currently using past model runs to sample extreme events to better quantify their likelihood in the near-term climate through a method called UNSEEN. Decadal prediction systems gives us a better sample of extremes through their ensemble members - where a model is run multiple times each year to show different evolutions of the atmosphere. Using the ensemble members to see what *could've* happened, the likelihood of an extreme can be quantified more confidently through a larger sample size.
